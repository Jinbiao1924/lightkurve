    "We have discussed in [previous tutorials](http://lightkurve.keplerscience.org/tutorials/1.03-what-are-lightcurves.html) how Simple Aperture Photometry works. We choose a set of pixels in the image and sum those to produce a single flux value. We do this for every image as a function of time to produce a light curve.\n",

    "The [Kepler Data Pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/kepler-pipeline) produces an aperture, which is used by default by lightkurve. However, there are some cases where you might want to produce your own aperture. The field may be crowded, or you may wish to change the aperture size to change the relative contribution of the background. We can do this simply with lightkurve.\n",

Let's choose [KIC 6679295](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=KOI-2862.01&type=KEPLER_CANDIDATE). This is a Kepler planet canidate.
